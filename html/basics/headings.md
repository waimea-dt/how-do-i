# Adding Text to a Web Page

## Body Text

'Body' text is the name for the normal text that you see on web pages - the paragraphs of writing that make up most of the page.

```html
This is some normal, body text. It doesn't need any tags to indicate that it is text.
```

### Paragraphs

To break up text into paragraphs, use the `<p>...</p>` tag...

```html
<p>This is the first prargraph of text.This is the first prargraph of text.This is the first prargraph of text.This is the first prargraph of text.This is the first prargraph of text.</p>

<p>This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.This is the second paragraph.</p>
